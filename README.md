# MAGI

🔺🔻🔺

[![CI](https://github.com/retrobit/magi/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/retrobit/magi/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

Three AI models. One consensus.

Inspired by the MAGI system (IYKYK) concept — three independent supercomputers (MELCHIOR, BALTHASAR, CASPAR) that deliberate and reach consensus.

This project sends your query to three competing frontier AI models in parallel, then synthesizes their responses into a unified answer.

## 🤔 Why?

Any single LLM can hallucinate, hedge, or miss context. By querying three models from different providers and synthesizing their outputs, MAGI gives you:

- **Higher confidence** — Points where all three models agree are likely reliable.
- **Broader coverage** — Each model has different training data and reasoning patterns. Blind spots in one are often covered by another.
- **Built-in fact-checking** — Disagreements between models surface uncertainty that a single model would silently gloss over.
- **Provider independence** — If one provider has an outage, the other two still contribute.

## 🏗 Architecture

```

## ⚡ How It Works

1. **Parallel dispatch** — Your query is sent to all three models simultaneously via the Vercel AI SDK's `streamText()`. Total latency is determined by the slowest model, not the sum of all three.
2. **Independent responses** — Each model responds without knowledge of the others, ensuring genuinely independent perspectives. Model responses stream to the client in real time as they arrive.
3. **Consensus synthesis** — Once all three responses are in, the consensus engine streams a unified answer via `streamText()` that identifies agreements, resolves disagreements, and flags remaining uncertainty.
4. **Partial consensus** — If one or two models fail, the system proceeds with the available responses and warns the user that consensus is based on partial data.
5. **Multi-turn context** — On a follow-up query, each node replays only its _own_ prior turns (it never sees the other nodes or the consensus), and the consensus builds on prior consensuses. Token usage is tracked per node and against each model's context window.
6. **Prompt caching** — Because LLM APIs are stateless, every turn re-sends the whole replayed thread. An ephemeral Anthropic `cache_control` breakpoint marks that thread as a cacheable prefix, so Claude reads it back at ~10% of the input price on each follow-up instead of reprocessing it. OpenAI and Gemini 2.5 cache automatically; this closes the gap for Claude, which runs in the MELCHIOR seat on every paid tier.

## 🎨 UI Features

- **Multi-turn conversation** — Ask follow-ups; each panel keeps a scrollable per-turn transcript. Conversations persist per-tier in `localStorage` and survive reloads.
- **Live response progress** — While a query runs, the consensus panel shows a live "Waiting for MAGI — N / 3 responded…" count, with a "M failed" clause when nodes error out.
- **Token tracking** — Per-node input/output token counts, a cumulative conversation total, prompt-cache hits surfaced on hover, and a per-model context-window gauge that warns as a model nears its limit.
- **Pre-flight health checks** — Models are checked before dispatching. Unhealthy models show a clear error in their panel without burning tokens on any API call.
- **Per-tier model memory** — Custom node/model selections are saved per tier and restored on reload.
- **All UI settings persist** — Strategy, temperament toggles, generic labels, theme, background, and auto-scroll mode all survive a reload via `localStorage`.
- **Syntax highlighting** — Fenced code blocks in model and consensus responses are highlighted, with a token palette that adapts to dark and light mode.
- **Auto-scroll modes** — Off, Follow (pin to the newest streamed text while scrolled to the bottom), or Snap to top (jump each panel to the start of its latest response once that response finishes). Set in the ⚙️ settings menu.
- **Background variants** — Animated RGB columns, orbs, or off (settings menu).
- **Dark / Light mode** — Toggle via the ⚙️ settings gear in the top-right header.
- **Random prompts** — Click Execute with an empty input to submit a random thought-provoking question.
- **Copy buttons** — One-click copy on each node response, the consensus, and the prompt input.
- **Responsive layout** — Panels stack vertically on narrow viewports with scrolling; desktop uses a fixed side-by-side layout.

## 🎭 Temperaments

Each MAGI node has an optional **temperament** — a dispositional lens that shapes how it approaches a query. When enabled, each node receives a system prompt that steers its reasoning style:

| Node      | Temperament      | Guiding question                 |
| --------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------- |
| MELCHIOR  | 🧊 Rationalist   | "What do the facts say?"         |
| BALTHASAR | 🛡️ Caretaker     | "Who does this affect, and how?" |
| CASPAR    | 🔥 Individualist | "What feels true?"               |

- **Rationalist** — Cold logic, empirical reasoning, data above all else.
- **Caretaker** — Empathy-first, weighs human cost, safety, and wellbeing.
- **Individualist** — Bold conviction, authenticity, the perspective no one else would give.

Temperaments are **off by default** and can be toggled via the 🧠 button in the UI header or the `temperaments: true` flag in the API request body. When disabled, all three nodes respond without any system prompt, giving raw model output.

> **Note:** For direct-API models (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google), temperaments are sent as a native `system` message. For OpenRouter models, the temperament is prepended to the user prompt instead — OpenRouter's free-tier models do not reliably support the `system` role, and their API provides no way to detect support per model.

### Consensus Temperament & Awareness

When temperaments are enabled, two additional controls appear in the consensus panel. Their effect depends on the active strategy:

- **Consensus Temperament** — Active for both strategies.
  - In **Synthesis**, gives the synthesizer the consensus node's lens (a Rationalist synthesis prioritizes logic; a Caretaker weighs human cost; an Individualist gives bold takes).
  - In **Structured Voting**, each juror scores through _its own_ lens. Anonymity holds — a juror is told only its own temperament, never its peers'.
- **Temperament awareness** — Tells the synthesizer that each response came from a different lens, so it can surface _why_ perspectives diverge. **Synthesis only** — for Voting this toggle is greyed (with a tooltip), since voting has no single narrator to be "aware."

Both are independent toggles and off by default. With **Structured Voting** selected, the Consensus Node dropdown is also greyed and the consensus-temperament badge next to the panel title is hidden — voting tallies all jurors equally and has no single consensus node.

## 🎚️ Model Tiers

Users can select a tier to control quality vs. cost:

| Tier         | Anthropic         | OpenAI       | Google                |
| ------------ | ----------------- | ------------ | --------------------- |
| **Frontier** | Claude Opus 4.7   | GPT-5.5      | Gemini 2.5 Pro        |
| **Balanced** | Claude Sonnet 4.6 | GPT-5.4      | Gemini 2.5 Flash      |
| **Budget**   | Claude Haiku 4.5  | GPT-5.4 Mini | Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite |

| Tier     | Source                                                                |
| -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Free** | Dynamic — fetched from [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) at runtime |

> The **Free** tier routes all three nodes through OpenRouter. Available models are fetched dynamically from the OpenRouter API, so the list always reflects what's currently live. Three models from different providers are auto-selected as defaults. Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` to enable it.

## 🧠 Consensus Strategies

The consensus engine is pluggable. Available strategies:

- **Synthesis** — A model reads all three responses, identifies where they agree and disagree, and combines the best elements into a single unified answer. The consensus model is configurable via the `consensusNode` request parameter (defaults to the first node, MELCHIOR).
- **Structured Voting** — Each responding node acts as a juror that scores its peers' answers (anonymized as Candidate A/B) from 0 to 10. The highest aggregate score wins, and that response becomes the consensus, shown with a tally table. Juror calls use plain `generateText` + lenient score parsing, so voting works on every tier — including free OpenRouter models that don't support structured output. When **Consensus Temperament** is on, each juror scores through its own dispositional lens.

Future strategies (planned):

- **Multi-Round Debate** — Models critique each other's answers iteratively until convergence.

| `GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY` | Paid tiers | Google AI Studio key for Gemini models                                                       |
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`           | Free tier  | OpenRouter API key for free-tier models ([get one here](https://openrouter.ai/keys))         |
| `MAGI_API_KEY`                 | No         | Set to require Bearer token auth on `/api/magi`. Leave unset when using only the built-in UI |

### Development

```bash
bun run dev          # Start dev server
bun run build        # Production build
bun run preview      # Preview production build
bun run check        # Type-check the project
bun run test         # Run unit tests
bun run lint         # Check formatting + linting
bun run format       # Auto-format with Prettier
```

For manual UI testing, see [TESTING.md](TESTING.md).

In dev mode (`bun run dev`), a 🐞 button next to the settings gear opens a **dev-only debug panel** that injects synthetic error and context-limit UI states into the live turn — useful for exercising failure modes and near-full-context views without making a real model request. The button is gated by `import.meta.env.DEV` and never renders in production builds.

	method: 'POST',
	headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
	body: JSON.stringify({ query: 'What is consciousness?', tier: 'free', strategy: 'synthesis' })
});

const reader = res.body!.getReader();
const decoder = new TextDecoder();
let buffer = '';

while (true) {
	const { done, value } = await reader.read();
	if (done) break;

	buffer += decoder.decode(value, { stream: true });
	const parts = buffer.split('\n\n');
	buffer = parts.pop() ?? '';

	for (const part of parts) {

## 🧰 Stack

- **Runtime**: Bun
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Framework**: SvelteKit
- **AI SDK**: Vercel AI SDK
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Validation**: Zod

## 🔐 Security

- **Authentication** — Optional Bearer token auth via `MAGI_API_KEY`. When unset, the endpoint relies on SvelteKit's built-in CSRF protection (same-origin only).
- **Rate limiting** — Sliding-window IP rate limiter (10 req/min) with automatic stale-entry cleanup.
- **Input validation** — All requests validated through Zod schemas with strict type, length, and enum constraints.
- **Content-Type enforcement** — Rejects requests without `application/json`.
- **Timing-safe comparison** — API key checks use `crypto.timingSafeEqual` to prevent timing attacks.
- **Abort propagation** — Client disconnects cancel in-flight LLM calls to avoid wasting tokens.
- **No internal leakage** — Server errors are logged server-side; clients receive generic messages.

## 🚀 Deployment

MAGI uses [`adapter-auto`](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapter-auto), which auto-detects your deployment target. Works out of the box on:

- [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
- [Netlify](https://netlify.com)
- [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com)

For other environments, swap the adapter in `svelte.config.js`. See [SvelteKit adapters](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/adapters).

```bash
bun run build
```

Make sure your production environment has all required environment variables set.

> **Note:** The in-memory rate limiter resets on deploy/restart. For production at scale, consider replacing it with a Redis-backed solution.
